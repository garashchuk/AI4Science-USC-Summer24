ML for molecules

Tutorials: 
I. Python Scripting for Computational Molecular Science 
from the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)  
https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/ 

0. Setup do as needed. Make sure to obtain the lesson materials 

    Download the files needed for these lessons https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/data/data.zip
    Create a folder called cms-workshop on your Desktop.
    Move the downloaded materials to the new folder.
    Unzip the file.

1. (45 min)  Introduction 	What is the basic syntax of the python programming language?
2. (45 min) File Parsing 	How do I sort through all the information in a text file and extract particular pieces of information?
3. (35 min) Processing Multiple Files and Writing Files 	How do I analyze multiple files at once?
4. (100 min) Working with Tabular Data 	How do I work with numerical data presented in tables?
5. (40 min) Plotting and Data Visualization 	How do I visualize data by making graphs?
6. (40 min)  Writing Functions 	How do I write include functions in my code? 

Units 7-11 are optional. 
All units include hands-on exercises. 

Notes:  everywhere -- replace depricated 'numpy.float' with 'float'; there might be one-two typos in the materials that are easy to fix. 


What is not covered in this tutorial, but will be useful for the project: 
processing a sinlge file with multiple  molecules in xyz format of varied lengths.

IV. Project based on
'The tmQM Dataset—Quantum Geometries and Properties of 86k Transition Metal Complexes'
David Balcells and Bastian Bjerkem Skjelstad
J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2020, 60, 12, 6135–6146
Publication Date:November 9, 2020
https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01041

the data are available at https://github.com/bbskjelstad/tmqm 
or 
https://www.uiocompcat.info/tmqmdataset

We will provide a truncated version of the dataset. 

The goal: using standard ML models (sklearn) come up with  the structure descriptors (e.g. number of chemical bonds to the metal, type of metal and its row/column in the periodic table)  and correlate them to the computed properties  (e.g. the dipole method is important for stacking, homo-lumo gap is important for photochemistry and charge-energy transfer)
